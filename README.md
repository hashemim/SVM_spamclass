"Spam_SVClassifier" uses a linear support vector machine models to train this data and make a model. The model is then used on the test set.

"data_prep.py", "email_test.py", and "feature_extraction" include the functions that were used for email parsing and feature extraction.

"vocab.txt" is the vocabulary that was used for feature extraction.

The sample emails were obtained from spamassassin project.
